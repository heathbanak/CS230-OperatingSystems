•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was a company that had a successful game app developed for Android called Draw It or Lose It. They wanted to create a web-based version of the game to serve multiple platforms and expand their consumer base.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe my recommendations were well thought-out and provided comprehensive suggestions for code development.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document is a good way to prepare for developing the code. Through the design document, expectations and goals are clearly outlined and provide guidelines for the code development. The most important and least important aspects are clear, and it provides a comprehensive overview of all aspects of the software. Using the software design document throughout the development of the code helps the developer stay focused on the essentials and limits the likelihood of extraneous code.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise my software design document, I would add to the Design Constraints section. I feel more aspects of the software could be considered in this section, such as cloud platform options versus traditional systems and more specific security requirements.


•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user’s needs were interpreted and implemented into the software design. Consideration of the user’s needs is essential in designing code because the developer is designing a product for the user. If the developer is developing a software for themselves, they would design the code based on their needs and preferences. When the developer is designing code for a user, they must base the design off the user’s needs. For Draw It or Lose It, the user’s needs included the environments served, the gameplay required, storage and memory needs, and security implementations.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

This software was designed strongly based off the provided UML class diagram as well as other recommendations in the software design document. In the future, software design documents will be analyzed and understood before beginning the design of code.
